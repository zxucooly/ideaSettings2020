      <item value="* Various flavors of acquire, varying in exclusive/shared and * control modes. Each is mostly the same, but annoyingly * different. Only a little bit of factoring is possible due to * interactions of exception mechanics (including ensuring that we * cancel if tryAcquire throws exception) and other control, at * least not without hurting performance too much." />

      <item value="While the scoping mechanism for {@code synchronized} methods * and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks, * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks, * there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more * flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing * concurrently accessed data structures require the use of * &amp;quot;hand-over-hand&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chain locking&amp;quot;: you * acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire * C, then release B and acquire D and so on. Implementations of the * {@code Lock} interface enable the use of such techniques by * allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes, * and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any * order." />
      <item value="The use of {@code synchronized} methods or statements provides * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way: * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which * they were acquired." />
